**Online lectures and tutorials:** The access to online lectures and tutorials will be communicated via course mailing list. Course videos and materials belong to your instructor, the University, and/or other sources depending on the specific facts of each situation, and are protected by copyright. Do not download, copy, or share any course or student materials or videos without the explicit permission of the instructor. For questions about recording and use of videos in which you appear please contact your instructor.

**Accessibility:** The CSC413 teaching team is fully committed to ensuring accessibility for all our students. For the students looking for additional academic accommodations or accessibility services registration, please visit [www.accessibility.utoronto.ca](http://www.accessibility.utoronto.ca). Students are encouraged to review the course syllabus at the beginning of a course and discuss questions regarding their accommodations for the course with their Accessibility Advisor. Once registered, students should send the Letter of Academic Accommodations to our ticketing system at [csc413-2023-01@cs.toronto.edu](mailto:csc413-2023-01@cs.toronto.edu) as soon as possible by Friday, January 27th, 2023.

**Waitlist and enrollment:** CSC413 and CSC2516 always had long waiting lists for the last few years. The hard enrollment cap is determined by teaching resources available at the department level. Note that waitlists typically expire one week after the course starts. Once waitlists are removed, students are responsible for trying to enroll in the course on ACORN in a first-come, first-serve fashion. If you have further questions, please get in touch with [CS undergrad office](mailto:cs.undergrad@utoronto.ca) or [CS graduate office](mailto:gradoffice@cs.toronto.edu).
