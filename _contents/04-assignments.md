**Lateness and grace days:** Every student has a total of 7 grace days to extend the coursework deadlines through the semester. Each grace day allows for a 24 hours deadline extension without late penalty. That is, you may apply the grace days on a late submission to remove its late penalty. The maximum extension you may request is up to the remaining grace days you have banked up. We will keep track of the grace days on MarkUs. After the grace period, assignments will be accepted up to 3 days late, but 10% will be deducted for each day late, rounded up to the nearest day. After that, submissions will not be accepted and will receive a score of 0.
